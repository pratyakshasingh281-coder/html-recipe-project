<h1>Biscoff Cheesecake</h1>
<p>Welcome to a ultimate guide of making Biscoff Cheesecake.The Biscoff cheesecake is a decadent dessert that combines the creamy texture of a classic cheesecake with the distinctive, spiced caramel flavor of Belgian Lotus Biscoff biscuits and spread. The treat has gained significant popularity for its irresistible blend of textures and rich, unique taste. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h4><u>For the base</u></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Biscoff biscuits – We’re going to crush these up.</li>
  <li>Unsalted butter – Melt this quickly in a mug in the microwave.</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>For the cheesecake filling:</u></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Double cream – See tips below on the required whipping consistency</li>

  <li>Full fat cream cheese – I like to use Philadelphia brand cream cheese for this recipe. You can use other brands, but I find they are SLIGHTLY more difficult to combine.</li>
  <li>Biscoff spread – OBVIOUSLY!</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>For the topping: </u></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Biscoff spread – This will be very slightly melted.</li>
  <li>Biscoff biscuits – Again, to be crushed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Mix together the crushed biscuits and melted butter. Press the mixture into a tin and pop into the fridge to chill.</li>
  <li>Whisk the cream cheese, double cream and Biscoff spread together until very thick.</li>
  <li> Add the mixture to the base that’s been in the fridge. Refrigerate as per the recipe below.</li>
  <li>When almost ready to serve, melt the Lotus Biscoff spread gently in a pan or microwave. While still warm, pour over the cheesecake and smooth evenly. Crumble remaining biscuit over.</li>
